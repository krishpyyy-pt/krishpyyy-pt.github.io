    "intro": "Hi! I am Kavyansh Garg",
    "bio": "I am an aspiring Cyber Security Analyst and a Computer Application student, holding a Google Cyber Security Certificate. My core passion lies in solving complex, 'mind-boggling' problems, which led me from programming in Python and Bash to the intricate world of digital defense.I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence—exploring how AI can be leveraged for proactive threat detection and automated incident response, as well as understanding the unique challenges of securing AI systems themselves. With a strong foundation in security principles, hands-on programming skills, and a relentless curiosity, I am seeking a remote internship where I can contribute to a forward-thinking team and apply my analytical abilities to the evolving challenges of the AI-driven security landscape.",

      "description":"Engineered 'Fruity Cipher,' a custom 168-bit polymorphic block cipher. The algorithm implements a 'dynamic opcode' architecture where mathematical operations (Rotation, Permutation, XOR, and Modular Arithmetic) are randomized per block based on a generated 'Recipe.' It features a custom 24-bit integer processing pipeline, a global 'Banana' whitening phase for diffusion, and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) for avalanche effects. The system is designed as a Hybrid Cryptosystem, using RSA to securely encapsulate the polymorphic execution path (the Recipe).",
